    Description: Release notes for release 3.

GENERAL INFO

    Release 3 is the third and final release of LittleEngine. Overall I am
    quite happy with results and I think it has nice collection of useful
    features for making simple 2d games.

    Original plan was to try implement simple 2d light but I just didn't have
    time for that due being busy with physics, animations and example game.

    Physics works quite well. I had to invest a lot of information due never
    being studying physics for games and also lack of physics courses on my
    earlier education. Physics are not "as-real-as-it-can-be" but I think it
    suites quite well simple games.
