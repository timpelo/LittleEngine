    Description: Release notes for release 2.

GENERAL INFO

    Release 2 is the second release if LittleEngine. This release went quite
    as planned. Only change made was tiled maps. Due misunderstanding of the
    nature of tiled maps, there was implemented simple level map editor. This
    editor can be used to make simple game maps by loading assets (image
    files) and moving them in editor. LittleEngine has functionality to read
    file made by editor and build game level by reading the file.

    Editor has simple functionality. It can load assets from image files.
    User can add these assets to game canvas, move them and delete them. User
    can save map and load it to LittleEngine. Editor is in early stage and it
    does not yet show name of assets in selection wheel, only index numbers.
    It also can't yet load premade map (map can still be loaded to
    LittleEngine). It also has some minor bugs like menu bar not appearing
    before resizing of editor window.

    Editor still is misusing word "asset" in many variables and class names.
    These will be fixed for next release.
